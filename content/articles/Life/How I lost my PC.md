It was a day in July 4, 2022. Day was going on as usual. It was at 9:00PM in the night. My math teacher was about to come. But i had the weird idea to clean my PC.
I kinda successfully cleaned my PC before but I always am not careful with my stuffs.

Previously I fried my [ASUS B250G](https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b250g-gaming-model/) motherboard by breaking one of its SATA port during reinstallation. But somehow I managed to trick [Ryans](https://www.ryanscomputers.com/) into doing a Warranty claim and got a new motherboard ( again from ASUS | that's a story for another day )

# How I broke my PC

During the reinstallation of my CPU, I put the CPU the wrong way and kinda bent it inward. That's how i broke my first ever computer's CPU. The PC turns on but it cant power USB 3.0 ports.

Heres what it looks like

Half of the keyboard gets powered and half of it stays dark.
